### Q/A
#### Q: Why automatic sortie not supports events, combinded fleets?

A: Because I just want to upgrade my ship.

#### Q: Why the game is usually reload?

A: I didn't use graphic identification, just calculate the location then run the script,
so if your network is unstable, it's usually occurs.

#### Q: 2018 spring kancolle will upgrade to html5, will you update?

A: Yes, if I have time.

#### Q: Your code is ugly and grammar is too bad, can I improve it?
